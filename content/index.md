Welcome to the [OSRA](https://osralliance.org/) Infrastructure Project Site.
This project aims to support the ROS and Gazebo ecosystem by providing essential infrastructure, including buildfarms, documentation, and tools for ROS and gazebo packages.

This site is a work in progress and will be updated as the project progresses (and learn how to use Nanoc).
